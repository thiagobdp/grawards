When loading, data will be splitted in 3 entities: Indicated, Producer and Studio. 

Producer and Studio will be stored with non-duplicated names.

A rest service is available for consultation in "/indicated/fastestSlowestWinnerProducer" to get the producer with the longest gap between two consecutive awards, and the one with the fastest two awards.

Rest services for Producer and Studio are also available to list all records.
